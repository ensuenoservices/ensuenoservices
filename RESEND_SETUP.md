# Resend Email Configuration Guide

## Step 1: Create Resend Account
1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Verify your email address

## Step 2: Add Your Domain (Recommended)
1. In Resend dashboard, go to **Domains**
2. Click **Add Domain**
3. Enter `ensuenoservices.com`
4. Add the DNS records to your domain registrar:
   \`\`\`
   Type: MX
   Name: @
   Value: feedback-smtp.us-east-1.amazonses.com
   Priority: 10
   
   Type: TXT
   Name: @
   Value: [Resend will provide this]
   \`\`\`
5. Wait for verification (can take up to 72 hours)

## Step 3: Get API Key
1. Go to **API Keys** in Resend dashboard
2. Click **Create API Key**
3. Name it: "EnSueÃ±o Services Website"
4. Select **Sending access**
5. Copy the API key (starts with `re_`)

## Step 4: Configure Vercel Environment Variables
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Click **Settings** â†’ **Environment Variables**
3. Add new variable:
   - **Name**: `RESEND_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: Your API key from step 3
   - **Environment**: Production, Preview, Development
4. Click **Save**
5. **Redeploy** your site for changes to take effect

## Step 5: Update Email Addresses (If Needed)
If you want to use a different email address, update these files:
- `lib/email.tsx` - Change the `to` and `from` addresses
- `app/api/contact/route.ts` - Update the sender domain

## Testing
1. After deployment, test the contact form
2. Check your email for notifications
3. Verify customers receive auto-reply emails

## Troubleshooting
- **Domain not verified**: Use `onboarding@resend.dev` as sender until verified
- **API key not working**: Make sure it's correctly set in Vercel environment variables
- **Emails not sending**: Check Vercel function logs for errors

## Free Tier Limits

## Upgrade Options
If you need more emails:
- **Pro**: $20/month for 50,000 emails
